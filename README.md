# GCLIB_GUI-Newmark-Agilent-
Made with love using: C# (.NET Winforms)

This application integrates the functions of a [Newmark Galil controller](https://www.newmarksystems.com/motion-controllers/nsc-g-series/), and an [Agilent PNA](https://www.keysight.com/en/pcx-x205186/pna-network-analyzers-300-khz-to-11-thz?cc=HK&lc=eng). Useful tool for researchers in my university, in particular the [CityU CRAE Lab](http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~amhwong/ "CityU CRAE Lab") headed by Dr. Alex Wong. <br/>
